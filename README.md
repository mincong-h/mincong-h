### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mincong

I'm a software engineer, currently working on data store automation at [Datadog](https://github.com/DataDog). The goal is to eliminate toil and simplify operations. During my free time, I write blog posts on <https://mincong.io> about Java and Elasticsearch to share knowledge with 20K users/month.
